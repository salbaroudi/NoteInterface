## Purpose:

This is a front-end example taken from a discontinued project (called Thought Catalogue). This code illustrate a jQuery interface. Text bubbles with tags can be dynamically made. They can also be pushed to a fictional Node.js server. The code will generate a json encoding for any text bubbles you make. Live version of the code can be found [here][link].
